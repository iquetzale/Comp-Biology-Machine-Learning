# Comp-Biology-Machine-Learning
A group project on the subject of computational biology

The goal of this project is to find out what are the most influential risk factors in the development of cervical cancer. Several supervised machine learning algorithms are used such as SVM, KNN, XGBoost, etc. We also highlight the use of RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) as a great feature selection algorithm that successfully reduced the utilized features from 30 down to only 6 features with minimal changes to accuracy and recall. 

Further details regarding the research can be read in the attached research paper. The dataset could be found in the attached csv and is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29)
